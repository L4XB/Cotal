/**
 * mutation-proof — prove a suite would actually catch the bug it claims to guard.
 *
 * A suite that passes with the change reverted proves nothing (AGENTS.md). The way to know is to
 * break the implementation on purpose and watch the suite go red **on its own line**. Doing that by
 * hand is a destructive experiment on a working tree, and every step of it has a way to lie:
 *
 *   - the mutation silently does not apply       → "unmutated" and "mutated" are the same run, and
 *                                                  the verdict is an accusation about nothing
 *   - the target string appears more than once   → you mutated something else as well
 *   - the suite dies EARLY for an unrelated reason → red, but not the red you claimed
 *   - the run never reached the new check at all → green that never executed the test
 *   - the restore silently fails                 → the next person inherits a broken tree
 *   - the mutation applied and the run NEVER SAW IT → the file changed; the thing under test read a
 *                                                  DIFFERENT copy of it. `@cotal-ai/core` resolves
 *                                                  to `dist/`, so a suite under `implementations/*`
 *                                                  audits the last BUILD, not `src`. Measured: two
 *                                                  authority changes to `endpoint-binding.ts` left
 *                                                  the 59-cell matrix audit fully green; with a
 *                                                  core build prepended, the same two mutations
 *                                                  KILLED on the assertions predicted for them.
 *                                                  Give such a mutation a `command` that builds
 *                                                  first — AND an `afterRestore` that rebuilds, or
 *                                                  the tree keeps a `dist/` compiled FROM THE
 *                                                  MUTANT after the source is put back. `dist/` is
 *                                                  gitignored, so git cannot be the recovery for it,
 *                                                  and the repo's own freshness check is an mtime
 *                                                  ORDERING test that a newer-but-wrong build passes.
 *
 * Each of those has happened. This runs the experiment so that none of them can pass as a result.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/mutation-proof.mjs --config mutations.json
 *   node scripts/mutation-proof.mjs --file <path> --find <str> --replace <str> \
 *        --command "pnpm smoke:x" --expect-red "<substring of the failing assertion>"
 *
 * Every mutation must name the assertion it expects to redden (`expectRed`). "It went red" and "it
 * went red for my reason" are the same exit code until you say which.
 *
 * A config filtered down to a subset (proving one new mutation without re-running the rest)
 * must select on the mutation's `find` string, never on its `cell`, `expectRed`, or `name`.
 * Those three are prose and get reworded; `find` is the code the mutation actually edits. A
 * filter keyed on the wording silently selects nothing, or worse selects the mutation as it
 * read BEFORE the rewording, and then proves the old claim while reporting the new one.
 * Measured here: a subset config keyed on `expectRed` outlived a cell rename and re-ran the
 * pre-fix mutation for a minute before the mismatch was noticed.

    // direct evidence the suite reached it. The reasoning is right; the implementation was not.
    // `output.includes(expectRed)` is a substring search over the whole transcript, and a suite that
    // prints `✓ <label>` on PASS satisfies it with a GREEN line. So a mutation that left the named
    // cell untouched and crashed the suite somewhere else graded KILLED, with the tool quoting back
    // the label of an assertion that had just succeeded. Measured, not argued: in the rig, a mutant
    // that made an unrelated guard THROW, named against a cell that passed, was reported
    // `KILLED — red, and named: <that cell>`.
    //
    // The fix keeps the right reasoning and gets the evidence right. The question is not "was the
    // label printed" but "did the named assertion CHANGE STATE", and the baseline run is the
    // control that answers it: the line the label appears on when the suite is green is known, so a
    // mutated run whose only occurrences are that same line has proved nothing about that cell.
    // That is strictly stronger than the tick floor AND it is direct, so it does not reintroduce the
    // false negative the floor caused on a suite's first assertion. Its one blind spot is a harness
    // that prints byte-identical text on pass and on fail; such a harness cannot be graded by any
    // signal this tool has, and no heuristic here should pretend otherwise.
    // EXIT STATUS IS CORROBORATION, NEVER THE EVIDENCE — in BOTH directions, and the second one was
    // found the same way as the first. A teardown that calls `process.exit(0)` after the suite has
    // printed real failures and set `exitCode = 1` produces a green status over a red run; graded on
    // status alone that is SURVIVED, and the tool says "the suite PASSED with the implementation
    // broken" about a suite that printed `✗ FAIL: <the named cell>`. Measured in the rig before this
    // was written. The failure direction is the cheap one — it accuses a working test instead of
    // blessing a broken one — but in a kill set it is exactly the verdict that makes someone rewrite
    // a test that already worked.
    //
    // So both branches ask the SAME question of the named assertion's own line, and only the answer
    // differs: a KILL needs a line the green run does not print, a SURVIVOR needs the line the green
    // run does print. Deliberately NOT adopted here: a rule requiring the suite to print its own
    // summary, a zero-failure count in it, or an incompleteness marker. Those need the grader to know
    // a suite's output convention, this tool grades hundreds of suites it did not write, and a guessed

// prove the mutation MUTATED. A mutant can install cleanly and alter no behaviour at all:
// prepend a duplicate object key and the last occurrence still wins; edit a branch nothing
// takes; reword a string no code reads. It compiles, it applies, the suite passes, and the tool
// says SURVIVED — an accusation against the suite for a change that never happened. An
// `ANCHOR NOT FOUND` guard cannot catch this, because the anchor WAS found.
//
// Output comparison does NOT settle it, and this is the trap worth naming: a GENUINE survivor
// also produces output identical to the green run. Measured — rewording a refusal message no
// cell reads survives at exactly 156 of 156, byte-identical. So "no observable difference"
// is the signature of BOTH the mutant that did nothing and the suite that does not care.
// Silence cannot separate them, in either direction.
//
// What does separate them is a POSITIVE CONTROL: another mutation in the SAME FILE that came
// back KILLED in this same run. A kill proves the suite reaches that file at runtime — not
// merely that it loads it, which the module specifier already told us. With such a control, a
// SURVIVED in that file is a real finding about the suite's coverage. Without one, the two
