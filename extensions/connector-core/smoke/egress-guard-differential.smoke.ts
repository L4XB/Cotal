/**
 * A replacement safety predicate graded against the predicate it replaced, on the same corpus.
 *
 * Every existing cell asks what the CURRENT function returns. None asks what the PREVIOUS function
 * returned for the same input, which is how three successive heads of the egress fence shipped a
 * classifier weaker than the one they replaced and no check named any of them. This file is that
 * check, for any pair of refs, over the frozen-body egress predicate in
 * `extensions/connector-core/src/agui.ts`.
 *
 * ROLE, NOT NAME. The export has already renamed and re-shaped once:
 * `frozenBodyViolatesEgressPolicy` (boolean) became `frozenBodyEgressVerdict` (three-way). A
 * harness pinned to one identifier is the next rename's first casualty. The loader reads that
 * file BY PATH at each ref and binds whichever exported function occupies the frozen-body
 * classifier ROLE. A boolean arm answers ALLOW / REFUSE / THROW. A three-way arm answers
 * clean / forbidden-kind / unreadable, and a throw from a three-way is recorded as a throw,
 * never coerced into a boolean. The comparison that names WEAKER / STRICTER is the explicit
 * publish mapping recorded next to the loader, not a silent `if (x) refuse`.
 *
 * AXES 1-15 were derived from the origin/main read pattern BEFORE any 1429 lane artifact was
 * opened (commit 8ff8eb763). Everything after that line is append-only: ADOPTED / NOVEL / LANE
 * axes labelled as such, then the corpus, the loader, and the two grading pairs. The forbidden
 * set is derived behaviourally from applyAguiEgressPolicy over Object.values(AGUI_EVENT_TYPE)
 * from the #1429 acceptance harness; the three ADOPTED axes are also from #1429, rebuilt here
 * rather than copied.
 *
 * Follows `packages/lang/smoke/differential.smoke.ts`: CORPUS / DIVERGENT / HELD, both-direction
 * grading, and prose on what a zero does not prove. #1426 is the adjacent reachability gap;
 * this instrument does not close it. T-PARSE and T-READONCE already pin the envelope class and
 * the representation class on THIS sha; this file's value is cross-ref grading, which neither
 * of them does.
 *
 * WHAT A ZERO DOES NOT PROVE. A differential is blind to symmetric loss by construction: two
 * arms that flatten the same way compare equal. The comparator here is the publish mapping
 * (withhold vs publish), so two arms that withhold for different named reasons still compare
 * equal on WEAKER/STRICTER. Those named disagreements live in DIVERGENT, pinned to both
 * answers, so retiring one reds this suite instead of quietly passing. A zero is also
 * corpus-limited: it does not speak to an input that is not a row, to a WAL encoder this
 * suite never runs, or to whether a live entry point reaches the predicate (#1426).
 *
 * Run: pnpm smoke:egress-guard-differential
