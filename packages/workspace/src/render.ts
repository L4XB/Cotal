/**
 * The single home for the toolchain's `cotal …` wording — optional and presentation-only.
 *
 * This is NOT part of the typed contract. Workspace internals never call it to decide behavior, no
 * control flow parses its output, and the rendered string is never baked back into a thrown error or
 * a result. A consumer that wants its own affordance — a web UI with a button, an SDK embed with no
 * command at all — reads the structured `{code, details}` / `{kind, …}` and ignores this entirely,
 * losing nothing. It exists so the CLI, the manager, and the delivery daemon speak the canonical
 * command copy with ONE voice instead of each hand-rolling it (the drift that motivated the split).
 * No colour, no `process`, no exit — the caller owns those.
