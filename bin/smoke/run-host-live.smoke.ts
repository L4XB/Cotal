/**
 * Manager-hosted workflow runs (SPEC 14.3) against the REAL manager and the REAL runtime host:
 * `run-start` / `run-resume` / `run-answer` / `run-status` / `run-ps` served on the ep rails, the
 * drive hosted in the manager's process under its own per-run credential, and a manager restart
 * taking a parked run back from its journal.
 *
 * Phase A is a JWT-auth broker: the caller is an `agent` credential carrying `capabilities: [run]`
 * and nothing else, so every reach the family needs is proven from the rows that capability mints.
 * The credential is an ISSUANCE (SPEC 13.15): its rails carry a generation, and a hosted run is
 * admitted under the ceiling that generation was issued for (SPEC 14.8).
 * Phase B is an open broker driven through the shipped `cotal run` client, the path a demo mesh
 * takes. Lives under bin/smoke because it composes the manager AND the runtime (implementations
 * never import each other; the composition root does).
 *
 * Needs nats-server on PATH. Run: pnpm smoke:run-host-live
