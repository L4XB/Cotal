/**
 * FULL-STACK AUTH RESTART-SUCCEEDS smoke (control-surface P2 item 3, slice 3c fold) — the deferred
 * "AUTH mesh + delivery daemon restart SUCCEEDS" assertion the manager-service smoke could only
 * cover as its LOUD no-daemon refusal.
 *
 * A REAL JWT-auth broker (system account) + a live delivery-admin eviction responder (the delivery
 * daemon's `evictPrincipal` op, served in-process here via the SAME core primitive the daemon uses:
 * `evictDeniedPrincipalWithCreds` over the two scoped $SYS creds). A Manager registers, accepts +
 * terminates a goal under epoch 0, then RESTARTS in the same workspace root. On an AUTH mesh the
 * registration barrier's PHASE 2 must VERIFY-EVICT the superseded serve family before the epoch
 * advances — so the restart drives the manager → `ctl.delivery-admin` → real eviction chain end to
 * end and SUCCEEDS: same logical instanceId, an ADVANCED process epoch.
 *
 * RETARGETED, along with `manager-restart-fence`, whose inverted pair this suite carries at 3c. It
 * used to assert that the predecessor's terminal was FENCED — invisible to the current-epoch reader
 * — under the epoch-scoped subject `…result.<execEpoch>`. That subject is gone: §13.2 reserved subjects reserves a
 * flat `…result` leaf, and the assertion was wrong: a verified eviction kills the predecessor, but
 * it does not retract what the predecessor already durably committed, and the pre-restart fact is
 * usually the real outcome rather than a corpse's guess. It now asserts the opposite and stronger
 * thing — the terminal SURVIVES the evicting restart, and the successor's contradictory second
 * terminal loses the create-only CAS.
 *
 * Run: pnpm smoke:manager-restart-live   (needs nats-server + node on PATH; boots its own JWT broker)
