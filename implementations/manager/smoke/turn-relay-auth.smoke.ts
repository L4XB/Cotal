/**
 * The turn relay on an AUTH mesh: a real JWT broker, the real Manager registered on it, a real
 * spawned seat that joined presence under the credential the manager minted for it, and the real
 * delivery-hosted timer writer. Every other turn suite runs on an open mesh, where the broker
 * enforces nothing, and that is how three grant holes shipped under green suites:
 *
 *   1. The manager minted the turn's deadline hold over its GOAL-WRITER connection, which holds no
 *      timer row. On an auth mesh the `.schedule` publish was broker-denied, every `turn` accept
 *      unwound with a `failed` terminal, and no run could ever drive a seat.
 *   2. The seat pulled its turns with `turn-pending` under its own credential, whose baseline
 *      carried self-mode `stop` and nothing else. The publish was broker-dropped, the connector
 *      read the silence as "no manager in this space", and the relay was dead for every seat.
 *   3. No profile minted a `turn` request row, the run driver's own `control-caller-admin`
 *      included, so a run's every turn submit was dropped at the broker before the manager saw it.
 *
 * So this suite asks the broker, not the code: a run-shaped caller submits a turn through the
 * ep rail; the seat's OWN minted credential pulls and yields it; and a turn nobody yields is denied
 * at its deadline by the manager settling the hold it owns, with no fire read at all.
 *
 * Run: pnpm smoke:turn-relay-auth   (needs nats-server + node on PATH)
