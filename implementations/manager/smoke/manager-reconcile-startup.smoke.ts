/**
 * STARTUP RECONCILE availability smoke (#755) — a real JWT broker, real durable orphan slot
 * rows, and a real Manager process. It proves the manager's typed control service is registered
 * while its static-orphan terminal sweep is still running, rather than holding the instance lease
 * while the whole space has no control plane.
 *
 * The fixture writes several ACTIVE orphan rows before start. The manager therefore cannot finish
 * reconciliation before the first terminal transition lands. We await that first transition, then
 * invoke `status` over the real ep.one rail. A green status reply while later slots remain ACTIVE
 * proves overlap and availability before sweep completion. In the old serial start() order, that
 * invocation has no service registration yet, so the assertion fails.
 *
 * The sweep still owns a per-alias gate: a new spawn for an alias whose row is being reconciled is
 * refused until that exact terminal attempt returns; it cannot race the terminal and reuse its name.
 *
 * Run: pnpm smoke:manager-reconcile-startup   (needs nats-server + node on PATH)

    // the delete, BEFORE the terminal CAS) the only in-memory answer a late yield can find is
    // turnAcceptances.settled. Two orderings both happen on a live manager and both have to name
    // the terminal the goal actually reached, never `not-found`:
    //
    //   1. terminal committed, index still present, settled answer not yet remembered
    //      (the window between pendingTurns.delete and rememberSettledTurn; also the window a
    //      concurrent sweep's maybeStopTurnSweep can clear turnAcceptances while the commit is
    //      still in flight, so rememberSettledTurn no-ops)
    //   2. terminal committed AND the index already cleared (the state the auth-mesh smoke's
    //      resultOf wait actually observes before it yields)
    //
    // Forced here through the same serveTurnYield door, after the durable deny is on the plane,
    // by dropping the in-memory maps the yield currently consults. No live timer, no broker
    // perturbation: the hold is minted already-due so expireCheckpoint is the shipped owner
    // expiry, and commitTurnDeadline is the shipped deny. Two goal ids, because the index
    // entry is create-only and cannot be restored after a clear.
